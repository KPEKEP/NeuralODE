# Neural ODE tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step tutorials on training an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model using a neural network and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). The tutorials illustrate the concepts and implementation details in both English and Russian.
